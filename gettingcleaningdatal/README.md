# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## The Purpose:

1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all 4. the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
5. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
6. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data used represent a data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

#### Description of the data:

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

#### The data used in the project:

[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

#### You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Before running the run_analysis.R:

* Download of the data source;
* Unzip the file;
* Put the file into a folder on your local drive.

#### Step by step to work with the R script:

* Pay attention on the necessery packages;
* Set your working directory rightly;
* Run the script

#### The output of the script will be: samsung_train_test_tidy.csv

You can access the details of the data in the **Code Book**.
